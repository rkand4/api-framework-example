(NOTE: THIS IS MERELY AN EXAMPLE THAT RUNS THE PARENT PROJECT)

My apologies but the parent project is now private; after much debate and after TWO SpringOne talks now with MASSIVE anger, confusion from my 'peers', I'm not sharing my code anymore.

Guillaume Laforge was nice enough to sit down with me for about 2 hours at SpringOne (and even attended my talk). He understood alot of what I was doing and I explained the problems that I had with the community. In short, he said I was introducing a change that was very hard for developers to easily understand, difficult to describe easily but had huge impact and that put me in a difficult position. Kin Lane also expressed that my changes were at least 5 years ahead of there time and that the industry had alot of catchup to get to where I was.

I have had alot of positive feedback from industry alot of confusion from individuals who don't understand the difference between centralized architecture and distributed architecture.

As such, I currently am developing in 'silence' my own platform, keeping all patents and trademarks and no longer sharing the technology as industries I have talked to want to co-opt my research and the development community has a very vocal minority that is amazingly rude and unreceptive.

My apologies for those who have used my work in the past.
