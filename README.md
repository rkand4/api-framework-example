(NOTE: THIS IS MERELY AN EXAMPLE THAT RUNS THE PARENT PROJECT)

My apologies but the parent project is now private; after much debate and after TWO SpringOne talks now with MASSIVE anger, confusion from my 'peers', I'm not sharing my code anymore.

Leaders in the industry like Guillaume Laforge (head of Groovy) and Kin Lane(API Evangelist) expressed that my changes were at least 5 years ahead of there time and that the industry had alot of catchup to get to where I was. Industry leaders like the API Manager of Netflix stated 'This fixes everything we are currently having issues with' when demo'ing the new API pattern, changes and functional improvements i was making.

I am patenting and trademarking my work where I can and am always looking for industry partners.

Feel free to reach out to me if you'd like to license my work or chat.
