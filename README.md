(NOTE: THIS IS MERELY AN EXAMPLE THAT RUNS THE PARENT PROJECT)

My apologies but the parent project is now private; after much debate and after TWO SpringOne talks now with MASSIVE anger, confusion from my 'peers', I'm not sharing my code anymore.

Guillaume Laforge was nice enough to sit down with me for about 2 hours at SpringOne (and even attended my talk). He understood alot of what I was doing and I explained the problems that I had with the community. In short, he said I was introducing a change that was very hard for developers to easily understand, difficult to describe easily but had huge impact and that put me in a difficult position. I told him this is exactly my point and that I don't know what to do as I can't keep fighting against the comunity but still want to make a contribution.

It was nice to have a calm ear to explain my issues to. He basically said that when recreating a paradigm (like I am) it creates alot of fear, confusion and even anger. But I pointed out that since I have no support, I become that focal point for the fear,anger and confusion.

In the long run, I told him that I came to this SpringOne with optimism but at the same time with a decision in the back of my mind: if I can breakthrough this barrier and explain my concept well enough that people could understand it, I would continue forward. If I couldn't, I would close all code and perhaps look at selling it to a company... but that I would not offer it to the community anymore.

Guillaume came to my talk and said afterward he understood it much more clearly and that I had laid everything out quite well. Unfortunately, outside of enterprises like Mashery, VMWare R&D, Apple, Paypal, Andreeson Horowitz, Netflix and others, I have found it too difficult to go alone without sponsorship or inclusion in another project as the developer community can be quite... hostile.

48 hours later it's back to the same old thing:

When I talk about my work, I get responses like the one above from people who don't even want to have a logical conversation, they just want to attack the individual.

And this isn't the first time, this is only the last straw of responses from developers who choose not to listen or contribute to the conversation and not to have a logical conversation on the merits and ideas of a concepts value.

As such, I can't do this anymore.

I'm removing myself from the conversation. This is not a rage quit (as some people have stated) as I tried to give it another shot and honestly had an face-to-face conversation with several people in the community who stated that I am in a tough position; enterprises understand and want it, developers aren't even listening and I'm not backed by anyone.

Perhaps at some future date I will offer this as a paid product.

I apologize sincerely to those who liked what I am doing and to those who I have talked to and found great value in it.

And perhaps I'm a bit of a sensitive developer but I do provide a single point of attack for those who can't have civil, logical, merited conversations on software development. And I can't be that person who sits back and ignores it. It hurts. And I don't like it and don't think anyone trying to present or present ideas should put up with this.

So I wish you all the best of luck.
